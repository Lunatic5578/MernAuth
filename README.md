# Auth Service

A completely self made advanced authentication service. 

<br><br> 
This is a web app made with MERN. This auth-service app has all the ability which are found in a professional authentication system.
<br> It uses a self designed password strength meter to detect password strength forcing users to create a strong reliable password for their own benefit.
<br> With a great UI this small yet complex web-app also uses google's smtp service to send emails for verification codes, reset password link, etc., and it comes along with a dashboard showing some details about the user logged in.
<br> The data is stored in a private database of MongoDB and uses password encryption from bcrypt to avoid any privacy concerns or issues.
<br><br> This web app is completely responsive and is supported in all devices.
